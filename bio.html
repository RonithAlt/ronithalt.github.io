        <p>I know a lot of people have trouble writing their bio. You wanna know the reason why? Honestly, it's because they've done nothing with their lives. Me on the other hand? Well don't worry, I have a ton of stuff to talk about because I've accomplished so much. In 1988, I won an award for best person in the whole world. The WHOLE. WORLD. Let that sink in. People sometimes just stop me on the street and they're like "damn man, you're the coolest." And I just say, humbly, "yes." People sometimes don't expect someone who is as successful as me to be humble but it staying humble is part of my core philosphy. I never brag, I never tell people I'm a billionaire. I never tell people how I went to Harvard when I was 9 years old and graduated when I was 12. That's just how good of a person I am. I'm successful and good.</p>
